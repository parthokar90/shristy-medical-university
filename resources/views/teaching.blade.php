              <p class="">
                We strongly believe medical education is in desperate need of innovation.<br>

                Traditional lectures with a large number of delegates are not sufficient to exchange vast amounts of complex information. Therefore, at Shristy Institute; we apply the following basic teaching principles:

              </p>


              <div >
                <h3 class="text-danger"><b> Blended Learning</b></h3>
                <p class="">Most of our courses are blended, meaning a combination of didactic lectures and onsite hands-on learning. It combines many of the best elements of face-to-face teaching (personalized learning and social interaction) while allowing greater variety and flexibility than a traditional classroom set up, responding to the needs of the modern learner. Printed copy and/or soft copy (for overseas or online students) of course content is available for course delegate’s on-demand; before, during and after the course.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-danger"><b> Hands-on Training</b></h3>
                <p class="">One of the biggest advantages of adopting a blended learning principle is the opportunity for more practical hands-on time. This allows us to skip hours of theory presentations. We know that ultrasound can only be taught by lots of practice, which we facilitate as much as possible in our courses. In addition, we work in small focused groups; a ratio of 5 trainees to 1 ultrasound system is being upheld in all short term courses.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-danger"><b> Evidence Based</b></h3>
                <p class="">All courses are, and generally should be, evidence based. Let’s first discuss what that exactly means. Below is the classic definition by Sackett – <br>
                  “Evidence based medicine is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. The practice of evidence based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research” (Sackett 1996). <br>

                  A continuous deliberate search for new academic research is required to keep our courses up-to-date. In today’s rapid and vast research cycle it is mandatory to update all our courses annually and to implement the latest evidence.

                </p> 

                 <h3 class="text-danger"><b> Embrace Life Long Learning</b></h3>
                <p class="">The path to becoming a Sonographer isn’t a straightforward paved path; rather it’s a continuous journey to deepening ones knowledge. After finishing one of our courses, the learning doesn’t end, it’s actually the beginning.
