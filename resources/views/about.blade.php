               <h1>Who are We?</h1><br>
               <p class="text-justify">
                Shristy Institute, a center of excellence, dedicated to education, training and research in diagnostic ultrasound. Since its inception in the year 2000, the institute has carved a niche for itself and has brought about a silent revolution in the field of practicing ultrasound, so that it has the distinction of being the first and only center in Bangladesh for ultrasound training as per protocol standardized by American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) and Sonography Canada.<br><br>

                In January 2000, we have started our first Advance Graduate Diploma in Medical Ultrasound course, first of its kind in Bangladesh and South Asia. It was an internationally accredited program, affiliated with The Michener Institute of Applied Health Technology, Canada, a public funded oldest heath technology institute in Canada. Under a pilot project, 36 Bangladeshi physicians in three groups successfully completed their 18 months Advance Graduate Diploma in Medical Ultrasound and obtained their credential directly from The Michener Institute, Canada. <br><br>

                In January 2003, we received the affiliation of Bangladesh Technical Education Board under the Ministry of Education continuing the diploma program with the transfer of curriculum and training expertise from the Michener Institute thus could be able to reduce the course cost substantially, keeping the same standard of education, training and guidelines provided by the Michener Institute.  <br><br>

                In June 2005, we have signed an agreement with Institute of Ultrasound Technique (IUT), Canada, to support our ultrasound programs. IUT assisted us to further improve the quality of courses and enhance its brand image through quality assurance and strategic planning support.<br>

              We have established a unique & innovative partnership program with IUT Canada & started an Advance Diploma Program for those who are already in the ultrasound profession, to enhance their scanning technique, with advance level hands-on training on different specialty ultrasound like Fetal Anomaly scan, TV/TR, 3D/4D ultrasound, Musculoskeletal ultrasound, Echocardiography & Vascular Doppler Sonography that is run under direct supervision of Dr. Hugh Ellis, a renowned Canadian Clinical ultrasound instructor with long experience as instructor. Currently, One year DMUD & ADMS certification are given jointly by IUT, Canada and Shristy Institute. </p>  <br>                          

              <h1>What is Our Aim?</h1><br>

              <p class="text-justify">Our principle aim is to develop quality healthcare human resources in the field of diagnostic ultrasound imaging in home and abroad. We are providing high quality didactic and hands-on training in different ultrasound modalities at tertiary level to local physicians, and also physicians, sonographers, radiology and ultrasound technologists from foreign countries.  We are committed to helping medical professionals keep up with and benefit from the rapid changes in healthcare technology today and in the future. <br><br>

                We have trained students from Nigeria, Zambia, Botswana, Somalia, Nepal, India, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, USA, UK & Canada and the horizon is ever increasing. <br><br>
                Our graduates after completion of their diploma courses, becomes eligible to sit for American licensing examination popularly known as APCA and ARDMS, who provides RDMS, RDCS, RVT, RMSK certificates, a globally recognized credentials in the field of ultrasound. Passing rate of ARDMS examination by our graduates is almost 100%. <br><br>

                We have also introduced short courses in different ultrasound specialty, designed to meet the needs of different medical professionals, especially emergency medical officers, General medicine, surgeons, gynecologists, obstetricians, pediatricians, gynecologists, radiology technologists, physiotherapist, cardiologists, as well as ultrasound application specialists etc., who need cross-training in ultrasound or who want to learn it right  for the first time to supplement their corresponding subjects.
